Objectives:
1. Data Cleaning - Afrah (Do it as soon as possible)

2. Data Analysis (The rest of the members)

Need the clean dataset before doing analysis

We don't need to use the entire dataset for analysis. You can just take one, two, or more columns to compare, detect outliers, visualization, etc. You guys can do any type of analysis on the chosen column. 

Taking the columns and doing analysis on it is considered as an objective.

You guys can do more than one objectives but minimum one.

How to do?
Do your objective under one R file named "Group 27"
